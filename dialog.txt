1somewhere over the rainbow
2way up high,, there's a land that i heard of once in a lullaby
3somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
4and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
5someday i will wish upon a star
6and wake up where the clouds are far behind me,,
7where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
